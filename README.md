# CYD-2USB-Bitcoin-display
a small bit of code to display the current bitcoin price and ETC price On a CYD 
I am very new to this and dont truely understand what I am doing but this sketch works with the CYD-2usb version as long as the correct USER_Setup in TFT_espi is set up.
Also dont forget to add your Wifi SSD and Password

Also here is a link to the correct CYD_2usb User_Setup for the TFT_espi library for the later version of the CYD
